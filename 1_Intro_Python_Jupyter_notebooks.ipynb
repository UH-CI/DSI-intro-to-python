    "We live in a world brimming with data and information. However, as data collection is becoming increasingly effortless, the burden of extracting valuable information is shifting to data science, which is a field of study where meaningful conclusions are drawn from analyzing large data sets. The conclusions extrapolated from these data sets have great potential to benefit many people and shape society. Although data science is a robust field on its own, it has a plethora of applications that can be seen in the industry, academia as well as people's personal lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning the principles and foundations of data science will not only help people become better data scientists, but also teach them to think critically from a broader perspective. Data science relies heavily on the use of programming for analyzing data and this module will introduce the foundations of Python which is one of the most useful tools in the data scientist's tool belt.\n",

    "This module focuses on learning the basics of Python in the context of data science. Python is an excellent programming language for data science because it is efficient and relatively easy to learn. Furthermore, Python is open-source, which means that it is free to download and install. The Python community is also very active with a lot of online support and open-source libraries for various applications including data science. Although this module focuses on Python applied to data science, Python is a great programming language for a wide variety of other applications. For example, Python can also be used to develop video games, model biological and biochemical processes, develop web based applications and much more!\n"
