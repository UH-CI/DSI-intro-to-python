This would be useful, for instance, to store longitude and latitude as keys, and some descriptor (ex. city name) as a value. \n",

Imagine what would happen if we changed the spelling of the word `adviser` in the dictionary to `advisor`. Users looking for the first version would be unable to find it and our dictionary would be incomplete. If the spelling of a word changes a reasonable behavior would be to create another entry in the dictionary to highlight this fact without changing the initial spelling. \n"
