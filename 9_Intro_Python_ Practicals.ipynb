ABO blood types are determined by the combination of alleles (different forms of a particular gene) that people inherit from their parents. Parents can either pass on an A, B, or O allele to their offspring, so every person will have two ABO alleles. Use nested for loops to create a list of all the different combinations of alleles a person can have, storing the varous genotypes as lists. Note that order does not matter in this case, so blood genotype `['A','B']` is the same as `['B','A']`. Make sure your code does not generate duplicate genotypes.\n","\n","\n","ii. Another blood type factor that is inherited independently from ABO blood types is the rhesus factor. There are two types of rhesus factor alleles: Rh+ and Rh-. Like ABO blood types, people will inherit one rhesus factor allele from each of their parents, totalling two alleles per person. Modify your for loop to take into account the different combinations of ABO alleles and rhesus factor alleles a person can have. Like with ABO genotypes, order of the rhesus factor alleles does not matter, so make sure you do not generate duplicate genotypes.\n","\n","iii. Now write a piece of code that evaluates all possible genotypes (the list created in ii) and generates a corresponding phenotype (what is physically expressed based off of an individual's genotype) in a different list. Below is a list of genotype to phenotype rules and a table of the different genotypes and their corresponding phenotype. The phenotypes you come up with should have both the rhesus factor and ABO phenotypes. Since we want the phenotypes to correspond to the different genotypes, do not delete dupicate phenotypes.\n","\n","  * A and B alleles are dominant to O alleles, so O alleles will be masked by A or B alleles.\n","  * If an A and  B allele are present, they will be codominant and will both be expressed.\n","  * Rh+ is dominant to Rh-, so Rh+ will be expressed if both are present.\n","\n","\n","| Genotype | Phenotype |\n","|-----------------|-------------------|\n","| AA| A|\n","|AO| A|\n","|BB| B|\n","|BO| B|\n","|AB|AB|\n","|OO|O|\n","|Rh+ Rh+| Rh+|\n","|Rh+ Rh-| Rh+|\n","|Rh- Rh-| Rh-|\n","\n","iv. How many ways can you achieve each unique phenotype? Write or find a function that counts the number of each phenotype in the list created in iii. Which phenotypes can arise from multiple genotypes? Which one has the most?\n","\n","v. Write a function that accepts two parent genotype in the form of a list of list of pairs of alleles (see below for an example) and returns all the possible offspring genotypes. Do not delete duplicates, as we will use the probability of offspring genotypes occuring later on.\n","```\n","example_parent=[['A','B'],['Rh+','Rh+']]\n","```\n","\n","vi.
